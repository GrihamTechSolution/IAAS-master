            Are you ready to look into the future of cropping systems, meet fellow agricultural students and go on 
            (real-life) excursions? During the International Conference for Youth in Agriculture 2022 (ICYA22) 
            from 10-13th March, we will focus on old and new cropping systems and how they can develop under the 
            topic of "Cropping systems for the future". In times of climate change, biodiversity loss, and changing 
            societal demands, it is worth broadening your scope as a young person in the field of agriculture. 
            ICYA22 will be the place to share your research, engage with others, go on (online) excursions and 
            attend inspiring lectures during the biggest agricultural conference organised by students.
